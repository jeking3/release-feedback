# release-feedback

GitHub Repository Releases are great, but lacking any feedback mechanism to let
you know a workflow is running, how it did, or where it may have placed third-party
assets.  release-feedback lets you push updates to your release description during
the release workflow.

## TL;DR;

```yaml
     - uses: jeking3/release-feedback@v2
       with:
         content: "- Beginning Build"
         release: ${{ github.event.release.id }}
         token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Example

The [example](.github/workflows/example.yaml) shows you how to:

1. Append to a release description during your workflow.
2. Use an environment variable in an action `with` statement through promotion.
3. Write longer, multi-line descriptions using standard YAML.

We use the example on our own [releases](https://www.github.com/jeking3/release-feedback/releases)
so you can see what the results of the example look like.
